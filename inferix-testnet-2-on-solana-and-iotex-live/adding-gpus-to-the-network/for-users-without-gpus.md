# For users without GPUs

### Important Information

If you don’t have GPUs but still want to participate in the staking program, you can invest in purchasing tIFX and stake a GPU from our B2B Partners.&#x20;

Inferix will help with this connection providing users a shared account; the mining profits of this participation are automatically split evenly at a **50%-50%** ratio based on the additional funds raised.

After buying tIFX for shared staking, user will be provided a shared account on [<mark style="color:blue;">provider.inferix.io</mark>](https://provider.inferix.io/) or <mark style="color:blue;">https://miner.inferix.io/</mark> to see their shared assets. At end of Testnet 2, each user involved on the staking will be provided a link for claiming their tIFX part from the shared account to their own account where they will be able to manage their assets, like normal staking-mining users.

Our partners have a large amount of GPUs from each allowed model available, so any user that buys tIFX now, can choose any type of GPU they want to join their shared staking according to the tIFX they buy.
