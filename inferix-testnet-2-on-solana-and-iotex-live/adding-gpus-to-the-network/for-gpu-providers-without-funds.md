# For GPU providers without funds

If you have GPUs but not enough funds to participate in the staking program, you can join our ["Connect for Testnet](https://discord.gg/rhaY6Z7yZd)ü§ù["](https://discord.gg/rhaY6Z7yZd) channel in our [official discord server](https://discord.com/invite/NJvcWYcB9W) to find users and form groups to collectively purchase a staking package for a single node.



On this scenario, the mining profits are split evenly at a **50%-50%** ratio based on the additional funds raised.
