To ensure you are eligible to convert your $tIFX into mainnet tokens after one year, you must:

* participate in running nodes for at least three months&#x20;
* provide GPU mining online in Inferix Testnet 2 for a minimum duration of 30 days&#x20;

To maximize your rewards from this airdrop, you can purchase additional $tIFX to stake and run nodes with higher-end GPUs. These additional $tIFX will be subject to unlocking and vesting rights according to the Testnet staking program, as outlined in the [<mark style="color:blue;">Staking Token Unlocking Rules</mark>](../gpu-staking-and-unstaking/unstaking-gpus.md) and [<mark style="color:blue;">Mining Revenue Unlocking Rules</mark>](../user-revenue-calculation/claiming-rewards.md) sections
