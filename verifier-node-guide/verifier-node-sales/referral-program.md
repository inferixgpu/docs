# User Discounts & Referral Program

### **How do node buyers create their own referral code?**

It is their wallet address. Anyone who purchases a node can refer someone else by passing them their wallet address to use as a code

### I am using a referral code for the Node Sale. What discounts do I get? <a href="#i-am-using-a-referral-code-for-the-node-sale.-what-discounts-do-i-get" id="i-am-using-a-referral-code-for-the-node-sale.-what-discounts-do-i-get"></a>

There are 2 types of referral codes available for use during the node sale:

### What benefit do users get for successful referrals? <a href="#what-benefit-do-users-get-for-successful-referrals" id="what-benefit-do-users-get-for-successful-referrals"></a>

Users with successful referrals (users used your code to purchase a node) will receive a 5% rebate in wETH

### Will referred users who input their friend’s wallet address as a code automatically get cashback? <a href="#will-referred-users-who-input-their-friends-wallet-address-as-a-code-automatically-get-cashback" id="will-referred-users-who-input-their-friends-wallet-address-as-a-code-automatically-get-cashback"></a>

No. A manual check will be done to verify if the referrer has actually purchased a node. Once confirmed, only then will the rebate be airdropped to the referee

### How will I receive my cashback? <a href="#how-will-i-receive-my-cashback" id="how-will-i-receive-my-cashback"></a>

The rebate you will receive is based on your total node purchase amount in wETH. After the team has verified you are holding a Verifier Node during the cashback period, you will be airdropped your wETH amount
