**Step 1 - Get wETH tokens to buy the Node and for gas fee.**\
_Nodes can be purchased using **wETH (Ethereum) on**_ [_**Arbitrum One**_](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/public-chains#arbitrum-one) _**Network** during sales._

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't know how to get wETH?&#x20;

* Goto [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/swap?outputCurrency=0x82af49447d8a07e3bd95bd0d56f35241523fbab1), connect your wallet and convert your token assets to wETH
* If you dont have enough token in your wallet, goto a centralized exchange, such as Binance, buy ETH and then send it from your Binance account to your wallet address using the Arbitrum One network
{% endhint %}

**Step 2 - Go to the Node Sale Page (**[**https://verifier.inferix.io/**](https://verifier.inferix.io/)**) and connect your wallet.**  \
Please take into consideration r_ewards from nodes will be airdropped to the same wallet used to purchase it, and this cannot be changed._



**Step 3 - Select available tier and click “Purchase”**\
There are a total of 30 tiers of nodes available for purchase.  For detailed information about each node read ["Verifier Node Sales"](./) and ["Verifier Node Purchase FAQ"](verifier-node-purchase-faq.md)



**Step 4 - Approve the purchase of your Inferix Node License**\
Click on “Approve” on the sale page. You will be prompted to sign a contract in your wallet. Once it has been signed, accept.

### **Congratulations you have now successfully purchased your Inferix Node License!**

\
**What’s next? Important info!**  :point\_down:\
4 weeks after purchasing an Inferix node, investors will receive an ERC-721 NFT to the wallet addresses used during the Inferix node sale. The NFT symbolizes ownership of the purchased Inferix Verifier node.&#x20;

Keep in mind that in order to run nodes, you will need a PC/mobile that match the min. requirements for EACH node license you buy.  ([Min. hardware req. ](../../inferix-whitepaper/appendix-c-hardware-requirements-for-nodes.md)[HERE](../../inferix-whitepaper/appendix.md)) There's **no cap** on the number of nodes you can buy **during whitelist sales**, but there's a **limit on the public sales.** (see info [HERE](./))&#x20;

The NFTs will be airdropped to buyer wallets directly, there's no claiming process. The NFTs will be non-transferable for the first year after the node sale. \
\
Nodes will be locked for a period of **a year** after the sale. After this lock-up period, you’ll be able to transfer or sell your node on the secondary market. You can also join our [Guaranteed Node Buyback](../../inferix-whitepaper/economic-model/node-sale-and-penalty-pool/guaranteed-node-buy-back.md) program after purchasing nodes.
