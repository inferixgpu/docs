**What’s next? Important info!**  :point\_down:\
After purchasing an InferiX node, investors will receive an ERC-721 NFT to the wallet addresses used during the InferiX node sale. The NFT symbolizes ownership of the purchased InferiX Verifier node.&#x20;

Keep in mind that you will need to match the min. requirements for EACH node license you buy.  ([Min. hardware req. ](../../inferix-whitepaper/appendix-c-hardware-requirements-for-nodes.md)[HERE](../../inferix-whitepaper/appendix.md)) There's **no cap** on the number of nodes you can buy **during whitelist sales**, but there's a **limit on the public sales.** (see info [HERE](./))&#x20;

The NFTs will be airdropped to buyer wallets directly at a later date. There's no claiming process. The NFTs will be non-transferable for the first year after the node sale. \
\
Nodes will be locked for a period of **a year** after the sale. After this lock-up period, you’ll be able to transfer or sell your node on the secondary market.
