# Verifier Node Purchase FAQ

1**. How many nodes are available for purchase?**

Inferix is offering 17,250 nodes across 20 tiers. Each tier has a limited number of licenses, and prices increase as the tiers progress.



**2. What are the steps to purchase a node?**

To purchase a node, follow these steps:

* Whitelist Sale (if eligible): If you are whitelisted, you'll have early access to buy nodes at a lower price during Whitelist Sale. The Whitelist Sale has 8 tiers of pricing, with increasing prices.
* Public Sale: After the whitelist sale, any remaining nodes will be available in the Public Sale on a first-come, first-served basis. Public sale prices will increase across the 20 tiers.



**3. Who is eligible for the Whitelist Sale?**

Whitelist participants include:

* Whitelisted (WL) users
* OG (Original Group) members

**4. What is the purchase token for the sale?**

Nodes can be purchased using wETH on Arbitrum Network during both the Whitelist and Public sales.



**5. Is there a purchase limit for nodes?**

Yes, there are limits during the public sale:

Tiers 1 - 8: There are specific purchase caps per wallet for these tiers:

* Tier 1: Max of 5 nodes per wallet
* Tier 2: Max of 10 nodes per wallet
* Tier 3: Max of 15 nodes per wallet
* Tiers 4 - 8: Max of 20 nodes per wallet

Tiers 9 - 20: There is no limit on the number of nodes you can purchase in these tiers.



**6. How does the pricing work?**

The price of each node increases with each tier. Here’s a brief outline of the pricing:

* Tier 1: $300 per node
* Tier 2: $350 per node
* Tier 3: $400 per node
* Tier 4: $450 per node
* Prices continue to rise until Tier 20, where the price reaches $1,250 per node.

Each tier has a limited number of licenses, so early purchases will be more cost-effective.



**7. Where can I purchase nodes?**

The nodes will be available for purchase directly on our Node Sale Page (link to be provided before the sale). Please ensure you have enough ETH in your wallet to complete the transaction.



**8. How will I receive my node?**

Once purchased, your node will be represented as an ERC-721 NFT, which will be airdropped directly to your wallet. This will happen 4 weeks after the sale is complete.



**9. Can I transfer my node after purchase?**

Nodes will be locked for a period of a year after the sale. After this lock-up period, you’ll be able to transfer or sell your node on the secondary market.



**10. What rewards do I earn as a node holder?**

As a node holder, you will earn $IFX rewards and possibly additional rewards, which we’ll announce in the future.



**11. When will the Inferix network launch?**

**Inferix Network will launch the mainnet after the TGE in November, 2024**
