To purchase a node, follow these steps:

* Whitelist Sale (if eligible): If you are whitelisted, you'll have early access to buy nodes at a lower price during Whitelist Sale. The Whitelist Sale has 8 tiers of pricing, with increasing prices.

Yes, there are limits during the public sale:

Tiers 1 - 8: There are specific purchase caps per wallet for these tiers:

* Tier 1: Max of 5 nodes per wallet
* Tier 2: Max of 10 nodes per wallet
* Tier 3: Max of 15 nodes per wallet
* Tiers 4 - 8: Max of 20 nodes per wallet

Tiers 9 - 30: There is no limit on the number of nodes you can purchase in these tiers.

***

**6. How does the pricing work?**\
The price of each node increases with each tier. Here’s a brief outline of the pricing:

* Tier 1: $300 per node
* Tier 2: $350 per node
* Tier 3: $400 per node
* Tier 4: $450 per node
* Prices continue to rise until Tier 30, where the price reaches $1,750 per node.

Each tier has a limited number of licenses, so early purchases will be more cost-effective.

***

**7. Where can I purchase nodes?**\
The nodes will be available for purchase directly on our [Node Sale Page](https://verifier.inferix.io). All node purchases are conducted using wETH tokens on the [Arbitrum One](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/public-chains#arbitrum-one) network. Please ensure you have enough wETH in your wallet to complete the transaction.

***

**8. How will I receive my node?**\
Once purchased, your node will be represented as an ERC-721 NFT, which will be airdropped directly to your wallet. This will happen 4 weeks after the sale is complete.

***

**9. Can I transfer my node after purchase?**\
Nodes will be locked for a period of a year after the sale. After this lock-up period, you’ll be able to transfer or sell your node on the secondary market.

***

**10. What rewards do I earn as a node holder?**\
As a node holder, you will earn $IFX rewards and possibly additional rewards, which we’ll announce in the future.

***

**12. How does the referral program work?**\
Inferix offers a referral program for both KOLs and users:

* **Users:** Your wallet address used for purchasing the node will serve as your personal referral code. You will receive a 5% commission and a 5% rebate on any node purchases made using your code.
