### Worker Rewards&#x20;

Worker rewards are composed of two parts: PoC rewards and PoD rewards. \
\
**PoC: Proof of Capacity** \
Proof of Capacity (PoC) is a blockchain consensus algorithm that allows mining devices in the network to utilize their available computational power to determine mining rights and validate transactions. PoC rewards are designed to encourage participants to keep their computational resources (containers) online and available, even when not actively processing tasks. This ensures a consistent and reliable resource pool for the network. Any container that remains online and meets the network's uptime requirements is eligible for PoC rewards. \
\
**PoD: Proof of Delivery**\
Proof of Delivery (PoD) verifies that mining devices in the network are genuine and have been successfully rented by third parties, earning additional rewards. PoD rewards incentivize participants to actively contribute computational power for rendering tasks and deliver highquality results. These rewards are granted to participants who successfully complete rendering tasks

### Reward Calculation

The total reward pool is determined based on the overall network utilization and activity. Individual rewards are calculated proportionally, considering factors such as the container's Kvalue (reflecting performance and capabilities) and its uptime.\

### Rental Revenue

Rental Revenue refers to the rent paid by tenants, with 95% of the daily rental income distributed to the GPU provider. A 5% protocol fee is deducted as a platform fee to cover operational costs and support further development. \
\
Daily earnings are distributed at 1:00 AM UTC. The release rules are as follows:\
\
• Worker Rewards: \
◦ 25% of the total revenue is released immediately. \
◦ The remaining 75% is linearly released over 180 days. \
\
• Rental Revenue: \
◦ Fully liquid and available for withdrawal on the same day.

### Claiming Rewards

• Worker Rewards: Claimable rewards from Worker revenue can be claimed. Once approved by the backend, they can be withdrawn to the user’s wallet. \
\
• Rental Revenue: Rental revenue can also be directly claimed. After backend approval, it can be withdrawn to the user’s wallet. \
\
Currently, the test network does not support claiming rewards.\
