In many cases, when a GPU owner does not have sufficient funds to stake, they can form groups to collectively purchase a staking package for a single node!

On the other hand, there are individuals with funds but no devices who are interested in staking.

In such scenarios, Inferix facilitates the connection between these two groups. The mining profits are split evenly at a 50%-50% ratio based on the additional funds raised.

When a user with a GPU registers for staking, the Inferix customer service team needs to ask how much they are able to contribute, and the remaining amount will be sourced from others willing to cover the difference.
