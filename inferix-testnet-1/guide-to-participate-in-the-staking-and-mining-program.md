# Guide to participate in the Staking & Mining Program

**FOR GPU OWNERS**

(Users need to meet the three requirements, check [docs](https://docs.inferix.io/inferix-testnet-1) )

* **Step 1: Register for an account** \
  Go to https://provider.inferix.io/ to create your account (please wait until your account gets approved, you will receive an email!)
* **Step 2: Purchase tIFX tokens** \
  How? Contact the Inferix team on our [official discord channel](https://discord.gg/q5gBts3Q6x) to buy tIFX tokens for staking and mining. **The price for testnet1 is 1 tIFX = 0.05 USDT**
* **Step 3: Connect your GPUs** \
  Follow [our docs](adding-gpus-to-the-network.md) or watch the instructional video to connect your GPU to the network and stake tIFX for rewards

### **FOR USERS WITHOUT GPU**

If you donâ€™t have GPUs but still want to participate in the staking program, you can invest in purchasing tIFX and staking. We will connect you with GPU owners, and **you will receive 50% of the reward tokens**

### **FOR INFERIX NODE BUYERS:**&#x20;

For those who purchased an Inferix Verifier node in September, there will be an airdrop of tIFX tokens:

* Each node is airdropped 15,060 tIFX, valued at 753 USDT at the time of Testnet1.
* After one year, this amount of tIFX can be converted into IFX on the mainnet, provided that the node has participated in running for at least three months and has joined Inferix's Testnet program.
* Buyers who purchase additional tIFX to stake and run nodes with higher-end GPUs will have these additional tIFX subject to unlocking and vesting rights according to the Testnet staking program, as outlined in the Staking Token Unlocking Rules and Mining Revenue Unlocking Rules sections.
