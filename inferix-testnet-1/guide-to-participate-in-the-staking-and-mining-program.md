### **FOR GPU OWNERS WITHOUT FUNDS**

If you have GPUs but not enough funds to participate in the staking program, users can form groups to collectively purchase a staking package for a single node; On this scenario, **The mining profits are split evenly at a 50%-50% ratio based on the additional funds raised.**

***

### **FOR USERS WITHOUT GPU**

If you donâ€™t have GPUs but still want to participate in the staking program, you can invest in purchasing tIFX and stake a GPU from a GPU owner without funds to participate. Inferix will help with the connection between these two groups; and **the mining profits are split evenly at a 50%-50% ratio based on the additional funds raised.**

### **FOR INFERIX NODE BUYERS:**&#x20;

For those who purchased an Inferix Verifier node in September, there will be an airdrop of tIFX tokens:

* Each node is airdropped 15,060 tIFX, valued at 753 USDT at the time of Testnet1.
* After one year, this amount of tIFX can be converted into IFX on the mainnet, provided that the node has participated in running for at least three months and has joined Inferix's Testnet program.
* Buyers who purchase additional tIFX to stake and run nodes with higher-end GPUs will have these additional tIFX subject to unlocking and vesting rights according to the Testnet staking program, as outlined in the[ Staking Token Unlocking Rules](gpu-staking.md) and [Mining Revenue Unlocking Rules](user-revenue-calculation.md) sections.
