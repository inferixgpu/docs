# Guide to get tIFX tokens

To purchase your tIFX, please contact the Inferix team ([official discord channel](https://discord.gg/q5gBts3Q6x).) \
\
We use OTC process for buying tIFX token:

1. User send USDT to project address, on ERC20 or BEP20 network: \
   **0x9798420f6520c48e9E9026292C222ac1207d6919**
2. When the transaction is confirmed, we will send tIFX to the user's wallet. **User must use IoTeX network address to receive tIFX.**

{% hint style="info" %}
**The exchange rate is: 1 tIFX = 0.05 USDT** \
It's confirmed the conversion rate will be 1:1 to mainnet tokens.
{% endhint %}
