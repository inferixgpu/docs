Springing from the visionary dream of our founder‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa dedicated educator in the field of architecture‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto decentralize a GPU Network and help all his students to access cost-effective GPU resources for their design projects, the Inferix team has taken purposeful strides towards this meaningful mission. We have become one of the true co-builders of DePIN narrative, especially within the Computing Network category.

Today, Inferix is proud to become a Member of DePINSurf Co-hort 1 and boasts a constantly growing community who are willing to become our true believers since the beginning. While rewarding the loyalty of early supporters, Inferix would love to welcome newcomers to actively join and co-contribute our network.

**‚Äã‚ÄãIt‚Äôs time for the launch of the Alliance Campaign‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääour most monumental campaign yet!**

***

#### **What is the Alliance Campaign?**

The Alliance Campaign is designed to represent and track how much a user has contributed to Inferix ecosystem and we believe that this is the premium method for us to reward early supporters and active users. It‚Äôs obvious that Inferix will be unable to achieve our aspirations without the collective strength of our community. Here‚Äôs where the **‚ÄúAlliance‚Äù** truly comes in!

The Alliance Campaign will be divided into two segments: **#ProQuest** and **#SoQuest.** Each offers different ways to earn rewards and users can take part in both.

**üèÜ Segment 1: #ProQuest**

_If you have idle GPUs & want to get rewarded for your invaluable contribution to the development of the network, this campaign is made for you._

**Duration:** 15 Apr‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää15 Jun, 2024

> _**Reward**_

Your activity and score will be used for airdrop distribution. We believe this is the best way to reward and incentivize our active and loyal members. More details to be announced in the coming days.



> _**How to join?**_

During the campaign, all participants would run nodes in Inferix to earn scores and compete on the leaderboard. The higher rank you are, the more $IFX tokens you‚Äôll get as exclusive airdrop.

Step 1. Go to our [**Website**](https://inferix.io/) & Download **MVP for GPU Providers**

Step 2. Check out the video tutorial to install Inferix Worker: [**HERE**](https://youtu.be/trDVtn48WLY)

_**Note:** For GPU Providers who install the old Inferix Worker before the campaign starting, remember to uninstall the old version and download the latest one from_ [_https://inferix.io/_](https://inferix.io/)_, then install and run it again to see your Node ID_

Step 3. Head over to [**Register Form**](https://inferix.io/register) and submit required information for verification, including:

**(1)** Your ioPay Wallet Address

_**\* Why ioPay?**_ _ioPay is the multi-chain DePIN crypto wallet developed by IoTeX‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa key partner of Inferix. In the future, we will integrate ioPay to support the $IFX token and provide a seamless experience for every user._

If you are new to ioPay, watch the tutorial [**HERE**](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IkZ1jl-pFxc) or visit [**ioPay website**](https://iopay.me/) for more info.

**(2)** Your email address

**(3)** Your node IDs

> _**How is a node score counted?**_

Inferix Benchmark is the rendering capabilities of the GPU set on the worker, which is determined by Proof-of-Rendering (PoR) algorithm. So your node score is based on a unique formula:

> **IBM = IB \* minutes of usage**

_\* **Inferix Bench (IB)**: is a measurement for node‚Äôs computing power_



> **Where can I see my score balance?**

Node scores aren‚Äôt on-chain. Inferix will publish and update a leaderboard here: [https://inferix.io/register](https://inferix.io/register) with certain specifics, including your scores, ranking, and other stats. This is where you can see how you‚Äôre doing compared to other Inferix users. It‚Äôs a friendly competition!

If you think your score balance is not correct, feel free to open a ticket in our Discord, and we‚Äôll be glad to validate the math.



**üèÜ Segment 2: #SoQuest**

_Players will gain Zealy XPs by completing given quests on #SoQuest sprint and climb the leaderboard to get amazing rewards. There will also have Initial XPs for our early supporters._

**Duration**: 15 Apr‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää15 Jun, 2024

**Massive Rewards**: 14,000 $IOTX and 140,000 $IFX in total
