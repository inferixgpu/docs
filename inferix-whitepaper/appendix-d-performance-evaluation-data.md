# Appendix D: Performance evaluation data

The detailed data for the performance evaluation is given tables below. In any table, each row shows the execution time (in second) of inserting a vector noise into a Blender scene whose name is given in the table name, and the time (also in second) of verifying the distortions regions on a frame rendered from the scene.

The tests are proceeded on a workstation of Intel:registered:Core:tm:i5 2.5 GHz CPU, 32 GB RAM. The noise insertion and noise verification do not need GPU.
