# Appendix D: Performance evaluation data

The detailed data for the performance evaluation is given in~\cref{tab:coca_cola_perf,tab:grease_pencil_bike_perf,tab:blender_35_splash,tab:bathroom_above_corner} hereafter. In any table, each row  shows the execution time (in second) of inserting a vector noise into a Blender scene whose name is given in the table name, and the time (also in second) of verifying the distortions regions on a frame rendered from the scene.

The tests are proceeded on a workstation of Intel\textregistered Core\textsuperscript{\texttrademark}i5 \SI[]{2.5}{\giga\hertz} CPU, \SI[]{32}{\giga\byte} RAM. The noise insertion and noise verification do not need GPU.
