# Performance evaluation

We evaluate the execution time of noise insertion and noise verification on several scenes, the lengths of the noise vectors variate from $$2$$ to $$40$$. The tests are executed on a workstation of Intel Core i5 2.5 GHz CPU, 32 GB RAM and NVIDIA GeForce RTX3070 GPU. The performance of noise insertion and verification is given in the figures below, detailed data is given in tables in appendix\labelcref{sec:performance_evaluation}.
