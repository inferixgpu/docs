# Structure of noise

As introduced in the previous section, a noise $$W$$ is a random vector $$\left(w_i\right)_{1 \leq i \leq n}$$ where each element is independently chosen from a normal distribution. This atomic watermark is constructed as a rectangular image of periodic patterns as follows:

* let fix some values $M,N$ for the width and the height of the rectangle, and
* let $\mathcal{X}\_i, \mathcal{Y}\_i$ be independent and identically distributed normal random variables:
