# Threat analysis

The threat analysis of ANGV is based on the previously mentioned [security model](/inferix-whitepaper/high-level-description/thread-model.md). It requires careful and sophisticated settings (it may be worth noting that the rendering problem itself is undecidable in general [[19]](/inferix-whitepaper/references.md#19)) then we refer the details to a technical report. We present only some basic results that can rapidly be proven from current settings.
