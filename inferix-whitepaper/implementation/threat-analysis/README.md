# Threat analysis

The threat analysis of ANGV is based on the security model mentioned in\cref{subsec:thread\_model}. It requires careful and sophisticated settings (it may be worth noting that the rendering problem itself is undecidable in general\cite{Reif1994}) then we refer the details to a technical report. We present only some basic results that can rapidly be proven from current settings.
