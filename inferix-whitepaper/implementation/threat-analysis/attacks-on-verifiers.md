# Attacks on verifiers

In case where _verifiers_ are compromised, we employ the consensus mechanism of the Inferix blockchain network: the verification will be executed by several _verifiers_ nodes through consensus. In order to minimize computational resource wastage, once two or more nodes reach a consensus, then the rendering result is considered successfully verified.
