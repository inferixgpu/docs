# Adaptive noise spreading

As discussed above, each atomic $$w_i \in W$$ has its distortion contribution at the spatial region $$k_i$$ on the rendered image. Since the rendering process contains multiple options to improve the quality of the output (noise reduction, anti-aliasing, etc.), it is severe if the region $$k_i$$(s) fall into perceptually insignificant regions\cite{Cox1997} of the image because the deliberate distortions raised by $$w_i$$(s) would be eliminated by the rendering enhancement. Hence, distortions are preferred to be placed in human perceptually significant regions. However, to keep the compromise between the fidelity of the rendered frames and the robustness of noise verification, the strength of the distortion of each $$w_i$$ must be tuned so that its deviation from locally enclosed regions is within a predetermined bound.

We handle this problem using the adaptive noise spreading\cite{Swanson1996,Podilchuk1998,Voloshynovskiy2000}. Research on the human visual perception agrees that the important information of images is located at high energy and low frequency spectral regions\cite{Jayant1993}. Then before embedding the object vector $$\Omega$$, we render the scene $$G$$ at some low settings to get a sampling instance of the image. Next, we proceed both the spatial and spectral analysis on this instance to get perceptually significant spatial regions, called preferred regions. The atomic noises $$w_i$$(s) will be placed in these regions. Simultaneously, we tune the expectation value $$\mu$$ used in generating atomic noises so that the energy (statistically given in\cref{prop:convergence_of_energy}) of high frequencies of the noises are sufficiently higher than the threshold used in the noise verification (c.f.\cref{subsec:noise_verification_implementation}).
