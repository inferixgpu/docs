# Client API and SDK

The core of all real-time rendering engines like Unity, Unreal Engine (UE), Three.js, and Babylon.js, Actif3D [[22]](/inferix-whitepaper/references.md#22)  lies in the combination of static space rendering (lightmap baking) and real-time rendering of dynamic elements. Lightmap baking is typically performed by developers during the game build process, but this process often requires several hours and expensive hardware. Traditionally, a large amount of CPU power was used for this task, but recently, most game studios have shifted to using GPUs. However, the costs associated with GPUs remain high, and the long rendering times result in significant waste and expense.

Inferix offers a decentralized infrastructure for baking lightmaps at a lower cost. Moreover, by leveraging parallel processing across multiple hardware setups in different locations, Inferix can significantly reduce rendering times for large-scale projects. To support this process, Inferix provides tools for lightmap baking through its rendering system, along with an SDK that enables the integration of these baked lightmaps into various rendering engines.
