# Introduction

This paper introduces Proof-of-Rendering (PoR) and its application in building Inferix's decentralized GPU network. Addressing DePIN Verification, the key challenge facing developers of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) recently, Inferix has developed the Active Noise Generation (ANG), Active Noise Verification (ANV), and PoR algorithms. These algorithms are combined with a software layer that includes middleware and client SDK, facilitating connections between 3D creative data systems and the decentralized GPU infrastructure. This creates a unique Decentralized GPU Network for Visual Computing and AI Inference.

At high-level, Inferix network is naturally a dynamic system where demands of digital content creators and supplies of GPU owners are created continuously over time. Users are concerned with the security and privacy of the system, with the facility of accessing computing resources, as well as with the price that they have to pay for their demands.
