# Manager

The Inferix network requires $$2500$$ Manager nodes, which will be sourced through Manager Node License sales. Initially, when the mainnet goes live, the _Inferix Foundation_ will deploy no more than $$100$$ in-house nodes of this type to ensure network availability. The plan for Manager node sales will be announced before the TGE. The reward pool for Manager Nodes is $$1.25\%$$ of the total supply of \$IFX tokens.
