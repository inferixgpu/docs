# Node Sale and Guaranteed Node Buyback

**1. Node Sales**

Node Sales are crucial programs for building Inferix's compute network. Participants in these programs are required to stake a certain amount of $IFX tokens by purchasing a node license. The number of $IFX tokens needed varies depending on the type of node and the timing of the license purchase. Node Sale programs will be organized into tiers based on the order of the sale. As a general rule, the earlier the license is purchased (the lower the tier), the cheaper the price. Licenses purchased before the TGE are referred to as Whitelisted licenses. Participants who acquire Whitelisted licenses will receive more benefits and discounts compared to those who purchase after the TGE.

**2. Guaranteed Node Buyback program**

In order to ensure the stability of node supply, increase transparency, and safeguard the rights of network contributors, Inferix introduces the very special _Guaranteed Node Buyback_ program

_**Eligibility:**_ Node license holders with a participation rate of over 66.7% in executing Inferix network tasks, and who have never been blacklisted, will be eligible to participate in this program.

_**Timeline:**_ Starting six months after the Token Generation Event (TGE), node license holders will have a 7-day window to participate in the Program.

_**Execution options:**_

_Buyback 100%_ with $IFX, value equivalent to the price of nodes denominated in USDT at the time of node purchase. 30-days linear vesting from time of buyback.

OR

_Immediate buyback 80%_ in ETH, value equivalent to the price of nodes snapshot in ETH at time of purchase. Immediate ETH release. To ensure transparency and security, Inferix will integrate the _Guaranteed Node Buyback_ program into smart contracts and collaborating with reputable, top-tier third-party auditors.

A portion of the repurchased node licenses will be reassigned to current active node operators to further boost engagement. The remaining node licenses will be sent to the Inferix treasury, with possible applications including distributing node operation rewards to $IFX stakers, reselling nodes, or burning them.

**3. Guaranteed Node Buyback fund**

To facilitate the _Guaranteed Node Buyback_, **10,000,000 $IFX** will be allocated from the _Ecosystem Fund_, as the _Guaranteed Node Buyback Fund_. Node license holders will retain all previously distributed airdrops, even after participating in the Program.
