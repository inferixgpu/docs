# Node staking and rewards

Inferix allocates up to 50\% of its total token supply as rewards for its node system, sourced from the Ecosystem Fund (c.f.~\cref{subsubsec:token_vesting}). Additionally, Inferix will distribute 80\% of its service revenue to the nodes through BMW model (c.f.~\cref{subsec:burn_mint_work_token_issuance_model}).
