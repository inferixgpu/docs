# Verifier

Verifier is also an important component in the Inferix network and is allocated 7.5\% of the total \$IFX token supply for the reward pool. Inferix mobilizes a total of approximately 25000 Verifier nodes through node sale programs. The first node sale program will be announced before TGE. In order to run a Verifier node, we do not need to invest in powerful hardware like Worker nodes, it is possible to run the verification on a mobile device (c.f. appendix~\labelcref{sec:hardware_requirements_nodes}).
