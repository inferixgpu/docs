# Governance

\$IFX token holders participate in the networkâ€™s governance decisions, including protocol updates, reward policy adjustments, and so on. This decentralized governance structure ensures the democratic and transparent nature of the network. Governance decisions are made through a weighted voting mechanism where \$IFX holdings determine the voting weights. This encourages long-term holdings and active participation in network governance.

The Inferix Network backend infrastructure is built on three core components: Worker Node, Manager Node and Verifier Node. With the expectation of serving 4 million designers, Inferix will have around $1$ million Worker nodes, with a significant portion coming from the PCs of the designers themselves. In a scenario where 4 million render jobs are processed daily, the Inferix network would require approximately 2500 Manager Nodes to efficiently coordinate and handle the PoR algorithm. In this scenario, Inferix would need approximately 25000 Standard Verifier Nodes to ensure the entire network operates seamlessly with low latency. A standard verifier node is a PC that meets standard verifier [hardware requirements](/inferix-whitepaper/appendix-c-hardware-requirements-for-nodes.md).
