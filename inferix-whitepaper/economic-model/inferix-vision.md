# Inferix vision

Inferix plans to implement a token economy model to incentivize individuals and organizations worldwide to share their GPU compute resources. This approach is designed to not only lower the cost of GPU resources and enhance efficiency but also create new revenue opportunities and business models for participants in the decentralized network.

Inferix envisions creating a fairer, more efficient, and sustainable distributed computing ecosystem through innovative technology and economic models. By challenging the traditional monopoly on GPU power, Inferix aims to promote the equitable distribution and efficient use of GPU resources, fostering the broader adoption and development of visual computing, AI, and blockchain technologies.
