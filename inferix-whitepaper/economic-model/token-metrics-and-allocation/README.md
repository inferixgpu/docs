# Token metrics and allocation

 * Token: INFERIX
 * Ticker: \$IFX
 * Max Supply: $$1,000,000,000$$ \$IFX

The total supply of \$IFX is determined based on the assumption that the Inferix network will serve approximately 4 million graphic artists and around 10 million end-users utilizing generative AI services. With 1 billion \$IFX tokens in circulation, the _token velocity_ of Inferix is expected to reach a minimum of 10.0, according to the Equation of Exchange $$M \times V = P \times T$$.
