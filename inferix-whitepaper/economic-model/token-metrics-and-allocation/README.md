# Token metrics and allocation

 * Token: INFERIX
 * Ticker: \$IFX
 * Max Supply: $$1000000000$$ \$IFX

The total supply of \$IFX is determined based on the assumption that the Inferix network will serve approximately 4 million graphic artists and around \SI[]{10}{million} end-users utilizing generative AI services. With \SI[]{1}{billion} \$IFX tokens in circulation, the \emph{token velocity} of Inferix is expected to reach a minimum of $$10.0$$, according to the Equation of Exchange $M \times V = P \times T$.
