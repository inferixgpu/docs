# Inferix Whitepaper

This paper introduces Proof-of-Rendering (PoR) and its application in building Inferix's decentralized GPU network. Addressing DePIN Verification, the key challenge facing developers of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) recently, Inferix has developed the Active Noise Generation and Verification or Proof of Rendering algorithm. The algorithm is combined with a software layer that includes middleware and client SDK, facilitating connections between 3D creative data systems and the decentralized GPU infrastructure. This creates a unique Decentralized GPU Network for Visual Computing and AI Inference.
