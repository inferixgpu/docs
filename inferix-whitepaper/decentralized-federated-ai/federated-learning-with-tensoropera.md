# Federated learning with TensorOpera

Federated learning and its practical benefits have recently started to see widespread application. This article will not delve into the concept of federated learning itself but will focus on applying it to leverage the GPU infrastructure of Inferix.

Several foundational projects have developed tools/SDK for federated learning developers. After extensive evaluation, we have chosen the open-source TensorOpera:registered: as the basis for developing the Inferix Federated Learning framework.
