  * NVIDIA GeForce RTX3090 GPU
  * 64 GB RAM
  * 1000 GB disk space
  * 100 Mbit/s internet connection

* Standard verifier node: The minimum requirements for a single license for standard verifier node are as follows:
   * 1 $$\texttt{x}$$64 Intel:registered: Core:tm: 2.1 GHz CPU
   * 8 GB RAM
   * 10 GB disk space
