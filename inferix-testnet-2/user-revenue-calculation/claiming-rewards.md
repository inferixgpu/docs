# Claiming Rewards

Daily earnings are distributed at 1:00 AM UTC. The release rules are as follows:&#x20;

* **Worker Rewards**:&#x20;

— 25% of the total revenue is released immediately.&#x20;

— The remaining 75% is linearly released over 180 days.&#x20;

— Claimable rewards from worker revenue can be claimed. Once approved by the backend, they can be withdrawn to the user’s wallet.&#x20;

* **Rental Revenue**:

— Fully liquid and available for withdrawal on the same day.&#x20;

— Rental revenue can also be directly claimed. After backend approval, it can be withdrawn to the user’s wallet.&#x20;
