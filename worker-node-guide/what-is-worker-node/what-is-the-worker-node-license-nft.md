# What is the Worker Node License (NFT)

The Worker Node License (as an ERC721 NFT)  allows you to be part of Inferix ecosystem, earning rewards by running a Worker Node Client. You can choose to run your Worker Node Client on your on devices matching the min. requirements. Check the min. req. and how to run the worker node [HERE](how-to-run-worker-node.md).

You can [purchase](../worker-node-sales/guide-to-purchase-worker-nodes.md) your NFT either from the [Node Sales](../worker-node-sales/) or through secondary market in the future. You also can refer the official [Smart Contracts Addresses](../worker-node-sales/smart-contract-addresses.md) of Worker Node sales.

Worker Node License NFTs  are non-transferable from the purchase wallet for the first year. Read more information on the Worker Node Purchase FAQ :point\_down:
