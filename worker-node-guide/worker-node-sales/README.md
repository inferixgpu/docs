# Worker Node Sales

You will be able to acquire Worker node licenses through Node Sales, crucial programs for building Inferix's compute network. There will be **2 type of Node Sales** for you to participate:

* **Whitelist Sale (if eligible).**
* **Public Sale.**

Node Sale programs will be organized into tiers based on the order of the sale. As a general rule, the earlier the license is purchased (the lower the tier), the cheaper the price.  Licenses purchased before the TGE are referred to as Whitelisted licenses. Participants who acquire Whitelisted licenses will receive more benefits and discounts compared to those who purchase after the TGE. (see info about whitelist [HERE](./))\
\
**Inferix is offering 100,000 nodes across 30 tiers**. Each tier has a limited number of licenses, and prices increase as the tiers progress. Here’s a brief outline of the pricing:

* Tier 1: $300 per node
* Tier 2: $350 per node
* Tier 3: $400 per node
* Tier 4: $450 per node
* Prices continue to rise until Tier 30, where the price reaches $1,750 per node

**The nodes will be available for purchase directly on our Node Sale Page** ([**https://worker.inferix.io/**](https://worker.inferix.io/)). Please ensure you have enough **USD₮0** _(USDT token on Arbitrum One network)_ in your wallet to complete the transaction.\
\
Once purchased, **your node will be represented as an ERC-721 NFT, which will be airdropped directly to your wallet.** This will happen 72 hours after the node is purchased.

***

During the **public sales,** there are limits on how many node licenses you can buy:&#x20;

* **Tier 1:** Max of 10 nodes per wallet
* **Tier 2:** Max of 20 nodes per wallet
* **Tier 3:** Max of 25 nodes per wallet
* **Tiers 4 - 8:** Max of 30 nodes per wallet

**Tiers 9 - 30:** There is **no limit** on the number of nodes you can purchase in these tiers. Each tier has a limited number of licenses, so early purchases will be more cost-effective. &#x20;
