# Worker Node Purchase FAQ

&#x31;**. How many nodes are available for purchase?**\
Inferix is offering 100,000 nodes across 30 tiers. Each tier has a limited number of licenses, and prices increase as the tiers progress.

**2. What are the steps to purchase a node?**\
To purchase a node, there's two types of sales:

* Whitelist Sale (if eligible): If you are whitelisted, you'll have early access to buy nodes at a lower price during Whitelist Sale. The Whitelist Sale has 8 tiers of pricing, with increasing prices.
* Public Sale: After the whitelist sale, any remaining nodes will be available in the Public Sale on a first-come, first-served basis. Public sale prices will increase across the 30 tiers.

A detailed guide, and a video walkthrough to purchase a node is available here :point\_down:
