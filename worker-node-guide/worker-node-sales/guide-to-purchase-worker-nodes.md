**Step 1 - Get USDT tokens to buy the Node and for gas fee.**\
&#xNAN;_&#x4E;odes can be purchased using_ [USD₮0](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xfd086bc7cd5c481dcc9c85ebe478a1c0b69fcbb9), the bridged [USDT ](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7)on [_**Arbitrum One**_](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/public-chains#arbitrum-one) _**Network**._

Don't know how to get USDT on Abitrum One Network?&#x20;

* Go to [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/), connect your Metamask wallet, in "**Select Network**" dialog set "**Testnet mode**" to **OFF**, choose your "From" and "To" network and convert your USDT token assets to USD₮0
* If you don't have USDT token in your wallet, go to a centralized exchange, such as Binance, buy USDT and then withdraw it to your wallet address using the Arbitrum One network
{% endhint %}

**Step 2 - Go to the Node Sale Page (**[**https://worker.inferix.io**](https://worker.inferix.io/)**) and connect your wallet.**  \
Please take into consideration &#x72;_&#x65;wards from nodes will be airdropped to the same wallet used to purchase it, and this cannot be changed._



**Step 3 - Select available tier and click “Purchase”**\
There are a total of 30 tiers of nodes available for purchase.  For detailed information about each node read ["Worker Node Sales"](./) and ["Worker Node Purchase FAQ"](worker-node-purchase-faq.md)



**Step 4 - Approve the purchase of your Inferix Node License**\
Click on “Approve” on the sale page. You will be prompted to sign a contract in your wallet. Once it has been signed, accept.

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you have enough ETH _on Arbitrum One network_ in your wallet to cover gas fee! A node purchasing order typically incurs gas costs equivalent to about $0.10–$1.00 worth of ETH.

Not sure how to get ETH on Arbitrum One network?

* Go to [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/), connect your Metamask wallet, in the "**Select Network**" dialog set "**Testnet mode**" to **OFF;** choose your "From" and "To" networks then convert your ETH assets to Arbitrum One ETH
* If you don't have ETH token in your wallet, go to a centralized exchange, such as Binance, buy ETH and then withdraw it to your wallet address using the Arbitrum One network

### **Congratulations you have now successfully purchased your Inferix Node License!**

\
**What’s next? Important info!**  :point\_down:\
Within72 hours after purchasing an Inferix node, investors will receive an ERC-721 NFT to the wallet addresses used during the Inferix node sale. The NFT symbolizes ownership of the purchased Inferix Worker node.&#x20;

Keep in mind that in order to run nodes, you will need a PC that match the min. requirements for EACH node license you buy.  ([Min. hardware req. ](../../inferix-whitepaper/appendix-c-hardware-requirements-for-nodes.md)[HERE](../../inferix-whitepaper/appendix.md)) There are limits on the number of nodes you can buy **during whitelist sales** and **public sales.** (see info [HERE](./))&#x20;

The NFTs will be airdropped to buyer wallets directly, there's no claiming process. The NFTs will be non-transferable for the first year after the node sale. **a** After this lock-up period, you’ll be able to transfer or sell your node on the secondary market. You can also join our [Guaranteed Node Buyback](guaranteed-node-buyback.md) program after purchasing nodes.
