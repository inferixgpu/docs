# Our Story

_"After over ten years of developing 3D software and teaching 3D graphics technologies, I have realized that the world of GPU hardware is being used in an unbalanced and extremely wasteful way. Millions of users have the need but lack access to expensive GPU hardware, while many GPUs are still wasted somewhere. We must optimize the way GPUs are used globally"_

_‚ÄúWith 6 years experience in growing web3 businesses globally like TomoChain and Coin98, I'm equipped with strategic mindset and deep understanding of the web3 landscape thanks to in-depth research. I think Decentralized GPU network and DePIN as tremendous opportunity for global web3 adoption‚Äù_
